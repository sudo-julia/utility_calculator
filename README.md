# utility_calculator

Based on Julian E. Andrew's code at <https://github.com/JulianEAndrews/utility_calculator>

[`user_data_dir.py`](./user_data_dir.py) is code from [appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs/blob/master/appdirs.py).
It's licensed under the MIT License, same as this code, and included as a snippet
instead of a dependency to allow this program to run on a base Python install.

## TODO

- [ ] Store data in database
- [ ] Add roommates interactively or through commandline arguments
